# Bioinformatics Software Development Project

## Enigma
Enigma is a versatile bioinformatics suite designed to assist researchers and bioinformaticians in various sequence analysis tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing a wide range of operations on DNA and protein sequences, from basic manipulations to advanced analyses.

## Features
- Sequence Input: Users can input DNA or protein sequences via text input or file upload.
- Sequence Manipulation: Perform operations such as translation, reverse complement generation, sequence randomization, and more.
- Alignment Viewer: Visualize sequence alignments using different algorithms.
- GC Content Calculator: Calculate the GC content of DNA sequences and visualize results.
- ORF Finder: Identify open reading frames in DNA sequences.
- Isoelectric Point Calculator: Calculate the isoelectric point of protein sequences.
- Secondary Structure Predictor: Predict the secondary structure (helix, sheet, coil) of protein sequences.
- File Format Converter: Convert sequence files between various formats (e.g., FASTA, FASTQ).
- Genomic Distance Calculator: Compute genomic distances between DNA sequences using Hamming or Jaccard methods.

## Getting Started
To get started with Enigma, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
- Access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Technologies Used
Enigma is built using the following technologies:
- Python: The primary programming language used for development.
- Streamlit: A Python library for building interactive web applications.
- Biopython: A collection of tools for biological computation, widely used in bioinformatics.
- Plotly: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
